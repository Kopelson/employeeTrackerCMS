# Employee Tracker CMS
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This project involved architecting and building a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation
How do you install this on in your own enviorment? Here are some guidelines:

* Clone the repository to your own device

* Run the company_dbSeeds.sql in MySQL Workbench
  -Note: Feel free to change the dummy information in this file
  
* Add your own password to the company_db.js 
  **IMPORTANT** this is a critical step to connect to your database
  
* In you terminal of choice install the necessary dependencies that are located in the package.json

* Start the server either through "nmp start" or "node server.js" command

* Enjoy!


## Potential  Bugs

The prompts in my server.js need queries to company_db.js to fill arrays with data which take time. I added an extra prompt before the array was used that fill the choices for the list type prompts. If the database becomes very large I fear this will need more time to populate the array. I noticed if the prompt immediately asked the user to pick from the array the array would be empty crashing or freezing the application. In a future update I plan on promisfying these so the prompt will wait for this information to populate.
